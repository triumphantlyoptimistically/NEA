# Running Event Planner

A C# application that plans running events by generating routes of varying difficulty using image-based route analysis, with persistent data storage via SQL databases.

## 🧾 Overview

The Running Event Planner is a desktop application developed as part of my A-Level Computer Science NEA.  
It allows users to create and manage running events by selecting a map image and choosing a desired route difficulty. The program then calculates and returns a suitable route while storing event, runner, and route data in a database.

The project focuses on algorithmic problem-solving, database design, and user interaction, simulating a real-world planning system rather than a purely theoretical exercise.
